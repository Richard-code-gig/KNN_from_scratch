# KNN_from_scratch
This programme aim to explain the priniciple of KNN Classifier algorithm by designing one from scratch.
From scratch means no library is imported apart from Matplotlib to plot data.
So, none of NumPy nor Pandas was imported to manipulate our matrices.
The matrices are used as lists of lists.
From scratch does not aim to reinvent the wheel but to show the principle.
